\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Subroutine for setting up the G\+FS hybrid coordinate vertical grid. Files with precalculated coefficients (A\+\_\+k and B\+\_\+k) from the \char`\"{}fix\char`\"{} directory in Patrick Tripp\textquotesingle{}s V2 code are used; their filenames start with \char`\"{}global\+\_\+hyblev\char`\"{}. There are only files for 28, 42, 60, 64, and 91 levels. If a different number of levels are specified, an error is returned. Using the A\+\_\+k and B\+\_\+k coefficients, the model level pressures, sigma values, and exner function (at interfaces and layer centers) are calculated and returned to the calling procedure. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
