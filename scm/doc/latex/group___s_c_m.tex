The prototype G\+M\+TB S\+CM can be thought of as an update to the existing G\+FS S\+CM to 1) use the N\+G\+G\+PS Interoperable Physics Driver (I\+PD) (and to keep up with its development) and 2) have the capability to run G\+C\+S\+S-\/style idealized cases. Its initialization draws heavily from the standalone I\+PD developed by Patrick Tripp at N\+O\+AA E\+MC. Many of the algorithms are heavily influenced by the original G\+FS S\+CM, and clues for implementation were also gleaned from how the I\+PD is implemented (called) in the G\+SM. The standalone driver demonstrated how to use the nuopc\+\_\+physics module to calculate tendencies due to radiation and the rest of the physics suite once, including initialization. It uses 8 columns and it initializes G\+FS state variables from unformatted binary output files that are (I believe) generated from a G\+FS model run.

The S\+CM prototype differs from the standalone driver in several important ways. First, although the state arrays will maintain a \char`\"{}horizontal\char`\"{} dimension (be capable of representing more than one column), the code is designed to use a single column. Second, in order to avoid becoming a G\+F\+S-\/only S\+CM, input is achieved through host-\/model agnostic net\+C\+DF files. In addition, variables needed to initialize or configure the physics suite are obtained through external namelist files to avoid using G\+FS output files. Third, the model will have the ability to use different vertical grids and coordinates as well as different time-\/stepping schemes (initial capability follows the G\+FS, however). Fourth, the S\+CM includes functionality to advance through time, calling physics repeatedly, and to replace dynamics/advection with specified large-\/scale forcing. \hypertarget{group___s_c_m_alg}{}\subsection{Main Algorithm}\label{group___s_c_m_alg}

\hypertarget{group___s_c_m_time_loop_description}{}\paragraph{Description}\label{group___s_c_m_time_loop_description}
The filtered leapfrog scheme can be represented as follows\+: \[ \frac{x^{\tau + 1} - \overline{x^{\tau - 1}}}{2\Delta t}=F^\tau \] where $x^{\tau + 1}$ is the value of variable $x$ at time $\tau + 1$, $\overline{x^{\tau - 1}}$ is its filtered value at time $\tau - 1$, $\Delta t$ is the time step, and $F^\tau$ is the collection of processes that change $x$ at time $\tau$. The Robert-\/\+Asselin filtered value of $x$ is given by \[ \overline{x^\tau}=(1-c)x^\tau + 0.5c\left(x^{\tau +1} + \overline{x^{\tau - 1}}\right) \] where $c$ is the filtering constant. This scheme is implemented in the code as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For the current time step (going to time $\tau + 1$), we have available at the beginning of the time step the filtered value $\overline{x^{\tau-1}}$ and the unfiltered value $x^\tau$. These are represented by state\+\_\+x(\+:,\+:,1) and state\+\_\+x(\+:,\+:,2) in the code, respectively.
\item At the beginning of the time step, these values are saved in a temporary array for use in the filtering step later.
\item In the do\+\_\+time\+\_\+step routine, nuopc\+\_\+rad\+\_\+run uses state\+\_\+x(\+:,\+:,1) (or $\overline{x^{\tau -1}}$) as input to calculate the heating rate at time $\tau$.
\item In the routine apply\+\_\+forcing\+\_\+leapfrog (in \hyperlink{group__forcing}{gmtb\+\_\+scm\+\_\+forcing}), two things happen\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Tendencies of the state variables due to the forcing are calculated for time $\tau$ ( $F^\tau$ above).
\item The state variables are stepped forward in time using \[ x^{\tau+1}=\overline{x^{\tau -1}} + 2\Delta tF^\tau \] In the code, state\+\_\+x(\+:,\+:,1) is simply updated. This variable is pointed to by the state\+\_\+fields\+\_\+in N\+U\+O\+PC D\+DT and is used as input for the physics call. At this point in the code, this variable no longer represents the filtered values from the previous time step, but the unfiltered state variables after their change due to the forcing and before their changes due to the physics.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item During the call to nuopc\+\_\+phys\+\_\+run, state\+\_\+x(\+:,\+:,1) is used as the starting point for the state variable and its unfiltered value is updated by the physics and stored in state\+\_\+x(\+:,\+:,2) (which state\+\_\+fields\+\_\+out points to). This is considered $x^{\tau +1}$.
\item Finally, using $x^{\tau +1}$ just calculated, and the saved values of $\overline{x^{\tau-1}}$ and $x^\tau$, the filtered value $\overline{x^\tau}$ is calculated by the subroutine filter in \hyperlink{group__time__integration}{gmtb\+\_\+scm\+\_\+time\+\_\+integration} to be used in the next iteration.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{group___s_c_m_time_loop_algorithm}{}\paragraph{Algorithm}\label{group___s_c_m_time_loop_algorithm}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Convert various calling frequencies to time step numbers.
\item Set all time steps equal to the \char`\"{}master\char`\"{} S\+CM time step
\item Update dyn\+\_\+parm D\+DT with new deltim.
\item Based on the time-\/integration method chosen, start the model time loop. Currently, only filtered-\/leapfrog is implemented.
\item Start the main time loop.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Calculate the elapsed model time.
\item Save previously unfiltered state as temporary for use in the time filter.
\item Call interpolate\+\_\+forcing from \hyperlink{group__forcing}{gmtb\+\_\+scm\+\_\+forcing} to interpolate the forcing terms to the model grid and time.
\item Update the pressure (and related variables) on the grid levels since some cases have a time-\/dependent surface pressure.
\item Recalculate sin and cos of latitude since xlon and xlat are time-\/dependent for some cases. (Column is moving in geographic space)
\item Before the time step is executed, perform various operations that are found in G\+L\+O\+O\+PR and G\+L\+O\+O\+PB before the physics time steps are executed in the G\+SM.

\item Update dynparm physics parameters before call to gbphys.

\item Update dynparm radiation parameters before call to grrad. (should this only be called on a radiation time step?)
\item Call do\+\_\+time\+\_\+step in \hyperlink{group__time__integration}{gmtb\+\_\+scm\+\_\+time\+\_\+integration}. This routine calls nuopc\+\_\+rad\+\_\+update and nuopc\+\_\+rad\+\_\+run (if necessary), apply\+\_\+forcing\+\_\+leapfrog from \hyperlink{group__forcing}{gmtb\+\_\+scm\+\_\+forcing}, and nuopc\+\_\+phys\+\_\+run. Each updates var(\+:,\+:,2), or the unfiltered values of state variables.
\item Call filter in \hyperlink{group__time__integration}{gmtb\+\_\+scm\+\_\+time\+\_\+integration} to perform the Asselin time filtering of the state variables.

\item The following code is from G\+L\+O\+O\+PR after the call to radiation. Since the calls to radiation and the rest of the physics in G\+SM are separate, this code might need to be executed before the call to nuopc\+\_\+phys\+\_\+run (gbphys), so I\textquotesingle{}m not sure if it is OK to put here...
\item Set some variables from the radiation output variables.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Write output (snapshot of filtered state variables) on the output frequency by calling output\+\_\+append from \hyperlink{group__output}{gmtb\+\_\+scm\+\_\+output}.
